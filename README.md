## Overview

This project contains two main parts:

1. A Book Club dApp
2. Guides for building dApps with zkSync Native Account Abstraction

---

## Book Club dApp

### Description

This project is a simple and intuitive platform where users can record their reading activities, participate in missions and challenges, and earn rewards. By incorporating gamified elements, the platform makes reading activities more enjoyable and encourages user participation. Based on Web2 user experiences, the platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a new reading experience. This allows users to increase their enjoyment of reading and feel a greater sense of accomplishment.

### Problems and Solutions

1. **Lack of Trust and Transparency**

   - **Problem**: On centralized platforms, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of reading records and reviews. There is a risk of data manipulation or forgery.
   - **Solution**: By utilizing blockchain technology, all reading records and reviews are transparently recorded and verified. Each record is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, and all changes are logged to ensure trustworthiness.

2. **Lack of User Motivation**

   - **Problem**: Traditional book clubs often fail to motivate users to engage in reading activities or write reviews. Recently, users have increasingly preferred reading activities based on experiences through pop-up bookstores or SNS interactions, necessitating methods to encourage active interaction.
   - **Solution**: Implementing a mission system and reading challenge system allows users to engage in reading activities and feel a sense of accomplishment. Completing missions or participating in challenges rewards users with points or tokens, thereby increasing their motivation.

3. **Data Ownership Issues**
   - **Problem**: On centralized platforms, the ownership of user-generated content (reading records, reviews, etc.) belongs to the platform. Users cannot fully control their data.
   - **Solution**: Through the dApp, users can own and manage their data. All records are stored on the blockchain, giving users transparent access rights to their data.

### Key Features

1. **Reading Record System**

   - **Description**: A system where users can store and manage the books they've read and their reading records. Users can invite others to join and share their reading activities.
   - **Record Fields**: Book title, author, reading date, review, etc.
   - **Record View**: An interface that allows users to easily view their reading records
   - **Benefits**: Users can visually track their reading history and monitor their reading progress. Additionally, they can share and communicate their reading activities with others, promoting interaction and making reading more enjoyable.

2. **Reading Challenge System and Badge Awarding**

   - **Description**: A system where users can participate in various reading challenges and earn badges and rewards upon completion.
   - **Challenge Participation**: Read a given book within a certain period or read books on specific topics
   - **Badge Awarding**: Badges are awarded upon completing challenges and displayed on user profiles
   - **Reward System**: Points or tokens are awarded for completing challenges
   - **Benefits**: Users feel a sense of challenge and accomplishment, motivating them to read more. Additionally, competing or collaborating with other users makes reading activities more dynamic.

3. **Mission System**
   - **Description**: A system where users can complete daily, weekly, and monthly reading missions to earn rewards.
   - **Daily Mission**: Example) Read 20 pages today
   - **Weekly Mission**: Example) Finish one book this weekend
   - **Monthly Mission**: Example) Complete this month's reading list
   - **Benefits**: Helps users maintain a consistent reading habit and provides a sense of accomplishment.

### Target Users

- **All Reading Enthusiasts**: Anyone who enjoys reading and wants a platform that makes reading activities more enjoyable, allowing them to communicate and compete with others. It is easy to use even without prior knowledge of blockchain technology.
- **Users Interested in Blockchain Technology**: Users looking for a new reading experience leveraging blockchain technology. Blockchain enhances the trust and transparency of reading activities and guarantees users' data ownership.
- **Users Who Prefer Community Activities**: Users who want a platform where they can communicate, compete, and collaborate with others. Reading activities increase user interaction and provide opportunities to meet new friends or reading partners.

### Future Roadmap

- **Short-term Goals**: Complete the mission system, personal reading record system, reading challenge system, and badge awarding features
- **Mid-term Goals**: Incorporate user feedback and improve UI/UX
- **Long-term Goals**: Add virtual events and workshops, integrate VR/AR technology

## Guides for Building dApps with zkSync Native Account Abstraction

### Introduction

A series of step-by-step guides to build decentralized applications with zkSync Native Account Abstraction.

The guides will cover the following topics:

- Social login integration
- Smart contract account creation
- Paymaster integration

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional dApp where users can:

- Sign in with their social media accounts
- Create a contract account
- Use gas-sponsored transactions by a paymaster
- Create reading logs for their favorite books
- Create reading challenges, join reading challenges, and earn rewards

> Each section will have a branch with the code for that specific feature.
